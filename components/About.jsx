          <p>
            Welcome to Dramatic Pages! I'm Theia Jain, a passionate high school
            student at Gems Modern Academy in Dubai. From a young age, I've been
            captivated by the world of dramatics and communication, diving into
            the realm of acting, writing, and directing plays. For me, theater
            is more than just entertainmentâ€”it's a powerful art form that allows
            me to express myself fully. Through Dramatic Pages, I aim to share
            my original work with the world, offering inspiration to fellow
            artists in need. Whether you're seeking a compelling script or a
            spark of creativity, I invite you to explore the pages of my passion
            project and unleash your artistic potential.
